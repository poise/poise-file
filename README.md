A [Chef](https://www.chef.io/) cookbook for advanced file management.

## Quick Start

To write out a JSON file from node attributes:

```ruby
poise_file '/etc/myapp.json' do
  content node['myapp']
end
```

To update a file in place:

```ruby
poise_file '/etc/hosts' do
  content 'otherhostname'
  pattern 'myhostname'
  pattern_location :replace
end
```

## Resources

### `poise_file`

The `poise_file` resource extends the core `file` resource to support formats
and patterns.

#### Formats

If the file path ends with `.json`, `.yaml`/`.yml` or `.sh/.bash` and
the `content` property is a Hash or Array object, it will be
automatically converted. You can also explicitly set the `format`
property to `:json` or `:yaml` to force formatting.

#### Patterns

Using replacement patterns allows editing files in-place in a structured manner.
This is similar to the `FileEdit` API or `line` cookbook/resource. The `pattern`
property takes a RegExp object or string pattern to match against. The value of
`pattern_location` controls how the `content` gets used relative to the `pattern`.

* `:replace` – `content` replaces the matching section. If the pattern does not match, the content is not changed.
* `:replace_or_add` – `content` replaces the matching section. If the pattern does not match, the content is appended to the end of the file.
* `:before` – `content` is inserted immediately before the matching section. If the pattern does not match, the content is not changed.
* `:after` – `content` is inserted immediately after the matching section. If the pattern does not match, the content is not changed.

You can also pass a Proc to perform arbitrary manipulations:

```ruby
poise_file '/etc/myapp.conf' do
  pattern proc {|existing_content| existing_content.tr('a-z', 'n-za-m') }
end
```

If you have an in-place editing scenario not handled by these operations, please
let me know by [filing an issue](https://github.com/poise/poise-file/issues/new).

#### Actions

All actions are the same as the core `file` resource.

#### Properties

* `format` – File serialization format. One of `:text`, `:sh`, `:json`, or `:yaml`.
  *(default: auto-detect)*
* `pattern` – Regular expression pattern or object to search for.
* `pattern_location` – Mode to use for the `pattern` replacement. One of
  `:replace`, `:replace_or_add`, `:before`, `:after`. *(default: `:replace_or_add`)*

All other properties as the same as the core `file` resource.
